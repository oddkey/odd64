Like so many others, I started my career as a programmer by learning BASIC on a Commodore 64. 
Many years later I found some old code I had written for a text adventure game. And to be honest, 
I didn't understand a thing about it. The code lacked comments, there were a lot of goto calls going 
here and there. And since the primitive BASIC dialect lacked the ability to create named functions 
and understandable variable names, it wasn't easy to understand what was going on.

It took me a long time to break some of the bad habits I had picked up at that stage in my life. 
I continued to use short one- or two-letter variable names, and even today I see that I could have 
been better at commenting my own code.

But is it unfair of me to put all the blame on the primitive programming language? Is it possible to 
write BASIC 2.0 code that is readable, functional, and doesn't look like cooked spaghetti? 
This was the challenge I set myself: To write a text adventure in BASIC 2.0 in the structural 
way of writing code that I have acquired in "better" programming languages, such as Python.
